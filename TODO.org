* TODO Compute lifetime holes
If a variable is last read at position 100, and written to at position 200,
then 100-200 should become a lifetime hole (unless it's in a loop).

There should be no save after 100 and restore before 200, as there is now.
* DONE "Another resolution case" unit test fails
There's an issue demonstrated by my unit tests that shows incorrect move
resolution at loop header blocks.  I've written to Christian about this, since
I'm quite puzzled on this one.  This is the last bit of work needed for
feature completeness on the Coq side.
* DONE Insert pseudo-use positions at loop end blocks
