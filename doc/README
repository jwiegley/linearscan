Environment variables:

* LINSCANDIR: If linearscan library is somewhere other than $HOME/bae/linearscan, do:
     export LINSCANDIR=/path/to/linearscan

* NOCOQ: if coq has trouble with the coq code embedded in coq_ environments
  and sent to coq via coq-tex, use "MyCoq" names in .tex file instead and do:
     export NOCOQ=1
  See wrap-coq-tex for a longer explanation.

The primary paper source is linearscan.tex

To compile the paper and evaluate the embedded coq code,
run 'make', with LINSCANDIR set appropriately and NOCOQ unset.

To compile the paper without running coq, just pdflatex the file as-is, 
or run 'make' with NOCOQ set.
