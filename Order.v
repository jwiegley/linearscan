(* jww (2014-11-19): Note that we are currently not computing the block order
   in any intelligent way. This is covered in quite some depth in Christian
   Wimmer's thesis.  At the moment we're simply accepting whatever block order
   is passed to us by the caller.  However, implementing this function
   properly is a strong means of improving the accuracy and efficiency of this
   algorithm. *)
